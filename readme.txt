My converter program checks if the file respects the pgm file rules, if it isn't a valid file then the process will be interrupted.  I used the Flood Fill Algorithm ( which helped me to find what blocks should I design. I had to use a dynamic allocated queue, because the recursivity calls caused me a stack overflow for fractal.pgm. My program writes the commands in a file named "converted.sk". The program isn't fully working and it takes some seconds to process the fractal.pgm file.
